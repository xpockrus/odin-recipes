        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Yes, even the <strong>All-Father</strong> has a sweet tooth! These flapjacks from the North will fill your belly on a cold winter's morn.</p>

        <p>You may ask yourself, "What makes these waffles different from my boring American waffles?"
        <br>Pssha! These delectables are thinner and softer, making them an excellent breakfast entree to pair with fresh fruit and whipped creme.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Greek yogurt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1-1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>pinch sea salt</li>
            <li>butter (for waffle iron)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Sing a song for the All-Father</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, beat the egg. Beat in the milk, yogurt and vanilla. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                <li>Make a well in the dry ingredients, and slowly pour in the wet ingredients while whisking it so it just comes together. Pour in the melted butter. Whisk everything together until it is smooth, being careful not to over mix. Allow to sit for 10 minutes. 
                </li>
                <li>In the meantime, heat up your waffle iron. When you are ready, make sure your waffle iron is fully hot. Lightly brush the bottom and top with melted butter. Gently scoop on the waffle batter, so it just covers the surface of the waffle iron. For my waffle iron, it about Â¼ cup of batter per waffle.
                </li>
                <li>Close the lid and hold it down for about 30 seconds (I find this helps the waffle batter spread evenly). Cook each waffle for several minutes. Repeat until all the batter is used.
                </li>
                <li>Serve immediately. The waffles will go soggy if you wait to eat them. Still delicious, but not as amazing.
                </li>
            </ol>
